This project is the second project for my university's networking course.
## <span style="color:#007FFF">Introduction</span>
The goal is to sniff packets in the network and show packet information such as source, destination, TTL, packet length, ...

 - The tool works with the following protocols: HTTP, ICMP, UDP, TCP,
   Ethernet, ARP and SSH.
 - Like wireshark, for every packet that passes through the network, the
   tool shows: Source, Destination, Protocol, Packet Length, TTL
 - For each of the above protocols, the tool analyzes the packet headers
   and show the specified details
